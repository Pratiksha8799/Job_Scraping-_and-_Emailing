- Scraping: Upon selection, the system initiates scraping of the chosen website(s) to extract job listings based on the provided criteria.
- Email Notification: Once scraping is completed, the extracted data is compiled into CSV files and sent to the user's provided email address.
- Logging: All activities including scraping errors and email sending status are logged for future reference.
